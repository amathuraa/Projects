# Project Files

This repository contains several PowerPoint and Excel files that I created for various university projects. The files cover a wide range of topics, including analytical and optimization-based modeling, mathematical and financial approaches to consulting problems, and more.

Some of the specific projects included in this repository are:

- Forecasting demand for seasonal goods and services
- Analyzing the feasibility of a third runway at Hong Kong airport
- Improving the Service Delivery of a Tutoring Center
- Creating an optimal course planner

These files are provided for reference and educational purposes only. Feel free to browse and use them as inspiration for your own projects.

## Repository Contents

- [Holtz Winter Forecasting](https://github.com/amathuraa/Projects/blob/main/Forecasting_Excel/Holtz_Winter_Seasonal_Forecasting.xlsx): An Excel sheet that predicts seasonal demand for a product using the Holtz Winter Forecasting technique. This product was implemented for a medium-sized convenience store, reducing spoilage of low shelf-life products by 84% and reducing shortages by 97%.

- [HKIA Investment Financial Analysis](https://github.com/amathuraa/Projects/blob/main/Consulting_Projects/HKIA_3rd_Runway_Financial_Analysis.pdf): A presentation containing a mathematical and financial analysis of the investment decision for a third runway at Hong Kong airport, including its impact on revenue forecasting, traffic, and airport rating. The study also includes sensitivity analysis and cash flow analysis.

- [Amazon VS Walmart Distribution Network Analysis](https://github.com/amathuraa/Projects/blob/main/Consulting_Projects/Amazon_VS_Walmart_D%26S_Competitive_Analysis.pdf): A PowerPoint presentation comparing the supply chain and distribution networks of Amazon and Walmart, with a focus on warehouse placement, stock, property, and financial statement analysis.

- [Course Planner](https://github.com/amathuraa/Projects/blob/main/course_planner/PROJ3010.xlsx): An Excel file that uses the Excel Solver module to solve [linear optimization problems](https://github.com/amathuraa/Projects/blob/main/course_planner/PROJ3010.docx) related to course prerequisites, graduation requirements, electives, and other factors. The goal is to allow students to input their course preferences and generate an optimal course plan to minimize semesters and maximize preference and recommendation.

- [Chase VS Level Strategy](https://github.com/amathuraa/Projects/blob/main/Forecasting_Excel/Chase_Level_Strategy.xlsx): An Excel file that determines if the Chase production strategy is an appropriate alternative to the Level production strategy based on certain inputs. The outputs are the respective costs of each strategy.

- [Tutoring Center Service Optimization](https://github.com/amathuraa/Projects/blob/main/Consulting_Projects/Tutoring_Center_Service_Engineering.pdf): A presentation made for a tutoring center in Hong Kong that provides primary education to children. After analyzing the service model, competition, and SWOT analysis, recommendations are made to improve customer retention and optimize revenue streams. The presentation successfully increased revenue for the firm by 17% in 2023.
